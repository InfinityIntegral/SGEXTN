# WORK IN PROGRESS

# SGEXTN CODE IS NOT DELETED, IT IS PLACED SOMEWHERE ELSE WHILE THE BUILD SYSTEM IS BEING SWITCHED TO CMAKE, THE PROJECT IS ACTIVELY UNDER DEVELOPMENT

SGEXTN v6.0.0 is a work in progress. When it is completed, we will bring back the README which is in something.md as of now.

I kept promising first v5.0.0 then v5.1.0 to be ready for development usage, but every time I ended up making more changes and adding more stuff. To avoid misleading users, SGEXTN v6.0.0 will NOT be ready for development use until the following conditions are met:
- [ ] SGEXTN v6.0.0 itself is done
- [ ] the 05524F GitHub pages + docs is done
- [ ] Colours++ is rebuilt with SGEXTN
- [ ] official demo app + tests for SGEXTN is done
