@SG_ML_TITLE Undefined Behaviour
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;Undefined behaviour in SGEXTN refers to when you pass something nonsensical into a SGEXTN function and the function does not check if the thing passed is nonsensical. Typically, this triggers a C++ @SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour.
&#9;As the words "@SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour" suggest, there is no guarantee on the behaviour of @SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour. Maybe it will appear to work, maybe it will crash, maybe it will open a cmd window and print "Why so blur leh" 100000000 times. There is no guarantee on what it will do.
&#9;In practise, most of the time, @SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour crashes or appears to work. The compiler does not like doing crazy stuff such as scolding you in Singlish repeatedly.
&#9;To avoid @SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour, always run clang-tidy on your code. SGEXTN header files are already optimised for clang-tidy usage, so running clang-tidy will not take too long.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;Here are some common causes of @SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour
&#9;- nullptr dereference
&#9;- use after delete and double delete
&#9;- out of bounds access
&#9;- signed integer overflow
&#9;- incorrect deletion of C array (use @SG_ML_L008014SGLArray../cppclass/sglarray to avoid this)
