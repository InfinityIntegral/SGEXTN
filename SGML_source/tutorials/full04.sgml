&#9;See @SG_ML_L004006herefull03 for the previous part of the tutorial.
&#9;In the previous part, we wrote the code to set up the inftroduction page inside the class SGCLPIntroductionPage.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
@SG_ML_HEADER_ testing the introduction page
&#9;With the introduction page ready, we can test it by pressing the run button and seeing what happens.
&#9;Still the same thing???
&#9;We have not asked SGEXTN to run SGCLPIntroductionPage::initialise yet. To fix that, we can declare a new function inside SGCLPIntroductionPage
@SG_ML_WARN static void activate();
&#9;We then implement the function by making it call @SG_ML_L01506CSGWBackground::enable../cppclass/sgwbackground#static_void_enable_SGWBackground_ptr_ref_SGWBackground_ptr_ptr_func_void_ptr_func_ to show the introduction page.
@SG_ML_WARN void SGCLPIntroductionPage::activate(){&#10;    SGWBackground::enable(SGCLPIntroductionPage::instance, &SGCLPIntroductionPage::initialise, nullptr);&#10;}
&#9;Here the reset function is nullptr as we do not need any. The reset function is supposed to be used for setting default values to input fields.
&#9;We then go to src/main.cpp, add the preprocessor include directive
@SG_ML_WARN #include &lt;SGCLPIntroductionPage.h&gt;
&#9;and add the line
@SG_ML_WARN SGXCentral::customInitialise = &SGCLPIntroductionPage::activate;
&#9;inside the implementation of init.
&#9;This tells the SGEXTN entry point to run SGCLPIntroductionPage::activate immediately after SGEXTN itself is all set up.
&#9;We can then test again.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;The introduction page now shows as expected. Excellent. Remember to commit this to Git.
&#9;Usually, this will not work because the source file was never added to the CMakeLists.txt, but in SGEXTN, that is handled automatically by @SG_ML_L018015BuildLah ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/buildlah so you do not have to worry about it.
