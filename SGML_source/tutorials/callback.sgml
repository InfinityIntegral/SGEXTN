&#9;Function pointers are used very extensively in SGEXTN as callback functions and replaces Qt's signal-slot mechanism.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;A function pointer is a special pointer to the code of a function. It can be passed around like any other pointer and also be called like a function. Callback functions in SGEXTN refers to function pointers to static member functions of classes, and they must return void.
&#9;The arguments in a function are part of the type when a pointer to the function is created. Therefore you must match the arguments and return type when writing to a function pointer.
&#9;To make a function pointer, you literally make a function into a pointer using &.
@SG_ML_WARN #include &lt;SGXDebug.h&gt; // necessary for debug logging&#10;#include &lt;SGXTimer.h&gt; // for the timer&#10;void func(){ // a function&#10;    SG("callback function called"); // log stuff&#10;}&#10;SGXTimer::singleCall(0.0f, &func); // &func is a function pointer to func
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;Function pointers are almost always exposed variables in SGEXTN and can be read from and written to directly. Modifying a function pointer property immediately changes the callback function being used. There is no need for connect or disconnect calls and no need for complicated MetaObject stuff that slow down compilation.
