&#9;See @SG_ML_L004006herefull01 for the previous part of the tutorial.
&#9;In the previous part, we set up our CMakeLists.txt
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
@SG_ML_HEADER_ writing main.cpp
&#9;Now we can click the run button on the bottom left of Qt Creator which looks like a green triangle.
@SG_ML_WARN :-1: error: ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: WinMain
&#9;oh... We forgot to write the main function... That was blur...
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;The main function in SGEXTN apps must use the SGEXTN entry point. If you have not done so already, first read this tutorial @SG_ML_L00400Ahereentrypoint.
&#9;For now, we just want to confirm that the CMake works, so we will not specify @SG_ML_L01C03DSGXCentral::customInitialise../cppclass/sgxcentral#static_void_ptr_customInitialise_func_.
@SG_ML_WARN #include &lt;SGEXTN_EntryPoint.h&gt;&#10;#include &lt;SGXCentral.h&gt;&#10;&#10;void init(){&#10;    SGXCentral::applicationName = "Colours++ - a SGEXTN demo app";&#10;    SGXCentral::applicationVersion = "v2.0.0";&#10;    SGXCentral::organisationName = "05524F.sg (Singapore)";&#10;    SGXCentral::folderName = "ColoursPlusPlus";&#10;}&#10;&#10;int main(int argc, char** argv){&#10;    return SGEXTN(argc, argv, &init);&#10;}
&#9;This code should go to src/main.cpp, since it is in the sources folder, @SG_ML_L018015BuildLah ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/buildlah ensures that it is automatically added to the CMake target.
&#9;We just set the basic information of our app using @SG_ML_L00A016SGXCentral../cppclass/sgxcentral static variables in our entry point for now. We can then click the "run" button.
&#9;If you see a window appearing, it means we did everything correctly. Excellent.
&#9;Fun fact: did you know that the status bar timer in every SGEXTN app displays the amount of time since the independence of Singapore in years?
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;Having a working SGEXTN powered window is a great achievement, so we should commit it onto Git. We use these commands below.
@SG_ML_WARN git add .&#10;git commit -m "initialise repository"&#10;git push
&#9;The add command adds all your changes to the stage, which is the group of changes to be committed. The commit command actually commits the changes, and the -m allows you to write a commit message describing what this commit is about. The push command syncs the remote repository (GitHub) with the copy on your computer.
&#9;In future parts of the tutorial, we will not be going through how to commit to Git again, instead the instructions would be something like "commit this to Git".
