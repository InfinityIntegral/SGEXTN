&#9;In the previous part, we set up our GitHub repository and Qt Creator project.

@SG_ML_HEADER_ setting up CMake
&#9;We continue with setting up CMake.
&#9;This used to be a very complicated process, but with SGEXTN version 6.2.0 and above, the @SG_ML_L018015BuildLah ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/buildlah CMake integration is now available.
&#9;You should probably read through the @SG_ML_L018015BuildLah ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/buildlah tutorial before continuing.
&#9;Now that you know how @SG_ML_L018015BuildLah ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/buildlah works, we can use it to write the CMakeLists.txt
@SG_ML_WARN cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21 FATAL_ERROR)&#10;find_package(SGEXTN REQUIRED)&#10;BuildLah_use_default_settings()&#10;project(ColoursPlusPlus VERSION 2.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)&#10;BuildLah_find_dependencies()&#10;BuildLah_add_component(ColoursPlusPlus_app GUI "." "" "" "ColoursPlusPlus" SGEXTN::SG_Containers SGEXTN::SG_Math SGEXTN::SG_Core SGEXTN::SG_FileSystem SGEXTN::SG_Widgets SGEXTN::SG_RI SGEXTN::EntryPoint_SG)
&#9;This does all the setup automatically and creates a normal (GUI) application target with its root folder at the current folder. We link it to all the SGEXTN modules that we are going to use.
&#9;The application now has its headers folder being include/, sources folder being src/, assets folder being assets/, and shaders folder being shaders/.
