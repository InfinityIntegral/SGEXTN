@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;The @SG_ML_L018015SGWidget ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/sgwidget module has automatic resizing for UI components through w-distance. This means if w-distance is used properly, your application UI would not look too bad on any aspect ratio except for really extreme ones.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;w-distance is used interchangeably in the SGEXTN documentation to refer to the 8 coordinate version describing the layout of a widget and the 2 coordinate version describing a single length.
&#9;1 size unit is the height of a line of text, this can be adjusted by the user after the customisation page is provided to them through calling @SG_ML_L03C059SGWCustomisationPageControl::enableFontSizeCustomisationPage../cppclass/sgwcustomisationpagecontrol#static_void_enableFontSizeCustomisationPage_func_.
&#9;The 2 coordinate version has a 1 coordinate and a 0 coordinate. The 1 coordinate represents a proportion of the parent width if the w-distance represents the length of a horizontal line, and it is a proportion of the parent height otherwise. The 0 coordinate is a proportion of the size unit. Parent refers to the parent @SG_ML_L018015SGWidget ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/sgwidget
&#9;The distance represented by a 2 coordinate w-distance is the sum of the distances represented by each coordinate. A 2 coordinate w-distance will be denoted as (c1, c0) where c1 is the 1 coordinate and c0 is the 0 coordinate.
@SG_ML_WARN distance = 1_coordinate * parent_width_or_height + 0_coordinate * size_unit
&#9;Note that either coordinate can be negative. Typically the 0 coordinate of the width and height of fullscreen UI elements can be negative for padding around the widget.
&#9;A 8 coordinate w-distance is denoted as (x1, x0, y1, y0, w1, w0, h1, h0). This means that the top left corner of the widget is at (x, y) in pixel coordinates where x = (x1, x0) and y = (y1, y0). The widget has a width of (w1, w0) and a height of (h1, h0).
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;Here are some commonly used w-distances for widget layout
&#9;fullscreen background - (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)
&#9;fullscreen textbox or scroll view - (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, -1, 1, -1)
&#9;full width textbox or input field - (0, 0.5, 0, ?, 1, -1, 0, 1)
&#9;page title - (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, -1, 0, 1.5)
&#9;most UI text - (0, ?, 0, ?, 0, ?, 0, 1)
&#9;invalid input warnings - (0, ?, 0, ?, 0, ?, 0, 0.75)
&#9;application icons - (0, ?, 0, ?, 0, 1.5, ?, ?)
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;If you still do not get it, try creating a @SG_ML_L00E01ASGWBlankWidget../cppclass/sgwblankwidget with different w-distances and see how it appears on screen.
