&#9;SGWidget is SGEXTN's highly customisable imperative GUI system. You can customise the layout of UI using @SG_ML_L01A016w-distance ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/wdistance and colours using @SG_ML_L01C018theme colour ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/themecolour.
&#9;To make user interactions such as typing in a @SG_ML_L008014SGWInput../cppclass/sgwinput or clicking a @SG_ML_L009015SGWButton../cppclass/sgwbutton trigger events, you need to use @SG_ML_L021015callback function ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/callback. Additionally, the @SG_ML_L01B018SingCorrect ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/singcorrect builtin functionality enhances user experience when interacting with input fields.
&#9;The base class for all UI elements is @SG_ML_L009015SGWWidget../cppclass/sgwwidget, you can look through its subclasses to see what UI elements are available.
&#9;SGWidget uses Qt Quick, so it is cross platform and GPU accelerated. However, you will not need to write a single line of QML or JS to use SGWidget. SGWidget is fully imperative.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;When designing UI using SGWidget, you should think in terms of UI pages. A UI page is everything that the user sees at a specific moment when using the application. All UI pages should cover the whole screen.
&#9;In code, a UI page corresponds to a subclass of @SG_ML_L00D019SGWBackground../cppclass/sgwbackground that is shown and hidden using @SG_ML_L01506CSGWBackground::enable../cppclass/sgwbackground#static_void_enable_SGWBackground_ptr_ref_SGWBackground_ptr_ptr_func_void_ptr_func_ and @SG_ML_L016044SGWBackground::disable../cppclass/sgwbackground#static_void_disable_SGWBackground_ptr_ref_ respectively. The internal logic ensures that at any time, only the most recently shown UI page is actually being displayed.
&#9;Always use @SG_ML_L01506CSGWBackground::enable../cppclass/sgwbackground#static_void_enable_SGWBackground_ptr_ref_SGWBackground_ptr_ptr_func_void_ptr_func_ and @SG_ML_L016044SGWBackground::disable../cppclass/sgwbackground#static_void_disable_SGWBackground_ptr_ref_ when showing and hiding UI pages. To show and hide UI elements on a UI page, even if it is a @SG_ML_L00D019SGWBackground../cppclass/sgwbackground, you still can only use @SG_ML_L01C032SGWWidget::setItemVisibility../cppclass/sgwwidget#void_setItemVisibility_bool_.
&#9;The background of UI pages should be direct children of @SG_ML_L017038SGWWidget::parentWidget../cppclass/sgwwidget#static_SGWWidget_ptr_parentWidget_. The UI elements on a UI page should be children of the page background.

&#9;The following UI layout recommendations will use @SG_ML_L01A016w-distance ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/wdistance.
&#9;As much as possible, keep the height of the average text at (0.0, 1.0).
&#9;Try not to put anything within (0.0, 0.5) of the edge of the screen.
&#9;Leave a gap of at least (0.0, 0.2) between any 2 UI elements.
&#9;Warning text for when the user enters invalid input should have a height of (0.0, 0.75).
&#9;Use a vertical spacing of (0.0, 0.5) between elements. If you need to fit a warning for invalid input, use (0.0, 1.0).
&#9;The title of a UI page can have a height of (0.0, 1.5), or even (0.0, 2.0) if you want to.
&#9;@SG_ML_L020014application icon ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/appicon should be at least (0.0, 1.5) tall for users to see it clearly, unless they are really simple.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
&#9;For custom rendering, you will need @SG_ML_L017015SG - RI ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/renderer. You can write custom shaders and send stuff to the GPU in a very simple way. The @SG_ML_L01101DSGRRendererWidget../cppclass/sgrrendererwidget is not interactive, so you need a transparent UI element on top of it for interactivity.
&#9;For custom interactions, use @SG_ML_L016022SGWSingleTouchReceiver../cppclass/sgwsingletouchreceiver or @SG_ML_L015021SGWMultiTouchReceiver../cppclass/sgwmultitouchreceiver, these will pass the exact position of the touch event to the corresponding @SG_ML_L021015callback function ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/callback.
