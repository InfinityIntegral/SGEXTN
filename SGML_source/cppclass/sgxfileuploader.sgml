Offers the user to upload a file. After the file is uploaded, the @SG_ML_L021015callback function ⁽㈳㈴㈳㈮㈱㈨㈠㈫ ㈧㈤㈱㈤⁾../tutorials/callback @SG_ML_B010attachedFunction will be called with the argument being the file path.
@SG_ML_NOTE If no file is chosen, the argument used to call @SG_ML_B010attachedFunction will be an empty string. This must be handled appropriately.
@SG_ML_NOTE The path is guaranteed to be in the application folder, the uploaded file is first copied into the application folder before @SG_ML_B010attachedFunction is called. You should move the file to the correct location in @SG_ML_B010attachedFunction.
@SG_ML_WARN @SG_ML_B010attachedFunction being nullptr is @SG_ML_L01301Fundefined behaviour../tutorials/undefinedbehaviour.
