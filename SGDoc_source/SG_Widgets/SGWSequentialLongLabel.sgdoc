@SG_CPP_CLASS SGWSequentialLongLabel
@SG_SHORT_DESCRP @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET multi line text label with adjustable height
@SG_LONG_DESCRP SGWSequentialLongLabel provides a @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET multi line text label that does not have a fixed height and can be used inside a SGWSequentialScrollView. However, this can only be used in a SGWSequentialScrollView since its changing height would disrupt the layout of other UI elements anywhere else.
@SG_IMPLE Stores information about the SGWSequentialLongLabel.
@SG_FUNC SGWSequentialLongLabel(SGWWidget* parent, const SGXString& s, float x1, float x0, float y1, float y0, float w1, float w0, float h1, float h0);
Creates a SGWSequentialLongLabel with parent @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET $parent, @SG_FINDREP_WDIST coordinates ($x1, $x0, $y1, $y0, $w1, $w0, ?, ?), text displayed $s, and font size as a @SG_FINDREP_WDIST ($h1, $h0).
@SG_NOTE Only place this inside a SGWSequentialScrollView.
@SG_WARN $parent being nullptr is undefined behaviour.
@SG_WARN To avoid use after free bugs, deleting a SGWWidget directly will cause a crash. Use SGWWidget::deleteWidget to delete it safely.
