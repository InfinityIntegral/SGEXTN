@SG_CPP_CLASS SGXFile
@SG_SHORT_DESCRP file access in the form of reading and writing
@SG_LONG_DESCRP SGXFile provides access to the file system by mainly reading from and writing into binary files. Support for text files exist but you can only read the whole file at a time. You should use binary files to store user data. The current location of the SGXFile pointer within the file is maintained and is moved automatically when reading or writing. This pointer can also be moved manually to follow offsets provided in the file.
@SG_IMPLE SGXFile wraps QFile and QDataStream with custom handling for SGEXTN structs.
@SG_FUNC SGXFile(const SGXString& s);
Creates a SGXFile associated with the file at path $s.
@SG_NOTE If the file does not exist or for whatever other reason cannot be opened, SGXFile::isValid is set to false.
