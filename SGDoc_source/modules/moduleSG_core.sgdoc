@SG_MODULE SG_Core
This is the core SGEXTN module providing access to structs, the application entry point, and debugging.
The module contains structs for colours in both RGBA and HSLA format, timestamps for date and time, 2 dimensional vectors, and identifiers with a registration system builtin. There is also a random number generator and a timer system that operates using @SG_FINDREP_FUNCPTR.
SGXChar and SGXString, both very helpful for text processing, are found here. These are recommended over <string> from the Standard Template Library or QString for more readable code and faster clang-tidy passes.
Read this @SG_ML_L008017tutorial../tutorials/entrypoint to learn how to use the entry point to set up a SGEXTN application, and this @SG_ML_L008012tutorial../tutorials/debug for debugging SGEXTN applications using the builtin debugging tool.
