@SG_MODULE SG_RI
The SG - RI module, both named after Raffles Institution and also short form for Renderer Interface, allows you to build custom renderers in SGEXTN.
This module should be used only to build renderers that display a custom @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET on the screen. This is not for 3 dimensional rendering or GPU based computation.
Every custom @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET has a SGRBaseRenderer that uses the shaders and optionally a SGRBaseSyncer for passing data to and from the shader. This is much simpler than OpenGL, Vulkan, or QRhi, but to use it properly you still must read through the @SG_ML_L008015tutorial../tutorials/renderer here.
The actual vertex and fragment shaders in the form of GLSL files must be compiled and then made accessible to the application through the resource system. @SG_FINDREP_SHADER @SG_FINDREP_RESOURCE
Note that since the colour picker internally uses this module, this must be linked for using colour pickers even if you are not building custom shaders. In fact, the colour picker is provided as SGWColourPickerWidget which is in this module.
