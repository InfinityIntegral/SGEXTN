@SG_MODULE SG_Widgets
The SGWidget module provides access to the @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET system and allows you to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This is needed for all non command line applications.
The SGWidget module uses Qt Quick internally to render, so all rendering is GPU accelerated and works on all GPUs. However, everything Qt is abstracted away, so you would never need to touch signal-slot, QML, or JavaScript. Note that @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET is a imperative, not declarative, GUI toolkit, making it more familiar to C++ developers. @SG_FINDREP_FUNCPTR is used instead of signal-slot for event listening and callback functions.
@SG_FINDREP_WIDGET has resizing builtin, so anything using it will resize automatically to fit the screen aspect ratio. This is done using @SG_FINDREP_WDIST. Use SGWCustomisationPageControl::enableFontSizeCustomisationPage to show the page allowing the user to change the font size.
@SG_FINDREP_THEME is also builtin and user customisable. You are allowed a set of 9 theme colours to build your application with, preferably they should be in a gradient. Note that every year around National Day, the theme of all SGEXTN applications will be switched to For Our Nation, the special National Day theme. To allow user customisation of application theme colours, you must link to the @SG_FINDREP_RENDERER module and call SGWCustomisationPageControl::enableThemeColoursCustomisationPage.
@SG_FINDREP_ICONFONT is used to display icons on buttons. Note that instead of SVGs or images, fonts are used. This means that the colour of icons always match the theme automatically. Using fonts also provide a performance improvement.
This module does not have builtin support for displaying images. For images, you need to build a custom shader, which is actually really easily done with @SG_FINDREP_RENDERER.
@SG_FINDREP_SINGCORRECT is builtin to all @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET input fields. This replaces @SG_FINDREP_SINGCORRECT commands, which look like LaTeX, with the corresponding Unicode character automatically, making it very easy for the user to input mathematical or scientific notation. Call SGWCustomisationPageControl::enableSingCorrectCustomisationPage to allow the user to customise their set of @SG_FINDREP_SINGCORRECT commands.
File uploading and file downloading functionality is provided through SGXFileDownloader and SGXFileUploader. This refers to bringing files into and out of the application folder, not actually transmitting them over a network.
