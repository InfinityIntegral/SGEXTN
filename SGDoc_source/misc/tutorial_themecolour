@SG_OTHERFILE_tutorials/themecolour Theme Colours Tutorial
The @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET module of SGEXTN has theme colours builtin. This makes it very easy to change the colour of the UI both by you and by the user.
By default, starting from SGEXTN 6.4.0, applications will use Sincerity UI.
Sincerity UI is WCAG compliant and based on the iconic 05524F pink. There are 6 colours.
0 - normal foreground
1 - hover foreground
2 - focus foreground
3 - normal background
4 - hover background
5 - focus background
These meanings are used by default. The colours on a specific @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET can be changed.
It is recommended that the theme colours form a gradient.

By default, Sincerity UI has 3 variations, Standard, Light, and Dark. These are accessible to the user in the configuration menu.
To align with your personal preferences or company branding, you can use a different default theme colour by writing to SGXThemeColoursCustomisation::themeColours inside SGXCentral::setCustomTheme.
@SG_ML_BLANKLINE
Every widget in the @SG_FINDREP_WIDGET system keeps track of if it uses theme colours at all. If you set a theme colour to anything on the widget, this is automatically turned on. If you set a colour directly, this is automatically turned off.
This means that a widget cannot use theme colours and custom colour simultaneously. However you can mimic the effect by setting a custom colour equal to the theme colour. Theme colours can be accessed through SGXThemeColours::getThemeColour.
Colour customisation is supported for all displayable SGWWidget subclasses, including SGWBlankWidget, SGWBackground, SGWLabel, SGWButton, and SGWInput.
