<h1 class="title">What is SGEXTN?</h1>
<p class="label">&#x9;SGEXTN is a framework built on top of Qt Quick. It provides essential functionality for building apps, such as a colour struct and file system access. The SGWidget module provides a full GUI toolkit to build UI without writing a single line of QML. SGEXTN also does not use signal-slot, instead callback functions are implemented using function pointers. Below is the full list of all SGEXTN classes with links to their documentation pages.</p>
